# Social App

Welcome to the unkown, welcome to social app. Here you will find a React web app for posting and share with friends, you can create and login to your profile, switch between dark and light theme, create posts with images, like other people's posts, see comments, add and remove friends, see indivual profiles and a movil response view. This is built under the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) with it's authentication for login, local storage and styled thank to the tailwind css framework.

## Social App backend

The API to handle all backend operations is built with Node.js, Express framework and Mongoose ORM, following best practices like password encryptation with bcrypt and token management with jsonwebtoken, authentication required for some routes with a custom middleware. It has a Models, Controllers and Routes structure.
